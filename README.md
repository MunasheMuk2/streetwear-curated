### Solved bugs

Boostrap cards

Encountered issues after using bootstrap cards for main content on homepage as initially the cards had image first and then header and paragraph but switched this with header and paragraph first and image second for the first card but this caused issues with re-arranging the paragraph to float to the write on bigger screens to match my wireframes

Also added an extra header on top of the 2nd card and this made it difficult to apply Css for bigger screens so took the header out of the bootstrap card

The first image and text also needed to be separated from all the other boostrap cards so the text could float on the right side of the image

display flex

Using display flex to center content on small screen devices was affecting bigger screens so used margin auto instead

text

Had to add absolute position in CSS to text I made float on the right on the first image as the text was going on top of image on larger screens

Subscibe success page

Had an issue centering the 'return to home' button for the sucess page with margin auto so ended up putting the button in a div and using text align - center
